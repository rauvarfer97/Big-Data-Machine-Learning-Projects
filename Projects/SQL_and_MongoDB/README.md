# A Comparative Study of Relational and NoSQL Databases

## Project Overview
This project presents a comparative study between relational databases (SQL) and NoSQL databases. It consists of several exercises that implement entity-relationship modeling, SQL database operations using PyMySQL, and NoSQL operations using MongoEngine.

## Contents

### 1. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (Exercise 1)**
   - File: `ERDiagram`
   - This diagram represents a banking system with clients, bank accounts, credit/debit cards, and transactions.
   - Entities:
     - **Client** (identified by DNI)
     - **Bank Account** (identified by account number)
     - **Card** (linked to both Client and Bank Account, identified by a unique card number)

### 2. **SQL Queries (Exercise 2)**
   - This exercise involves writing and executing SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data from a MySQL database.
   - Queries include basic SELECT statements, JOIN operations, aggregate functions, and data filtering.

### 3. **SQL Database Operations (Exercise 3 - PyMySQL)**
   - File: `excercise3.csv`
   - This file serves as the data source for SQL operations.
   - The script loads the CSV data into a MySQL database and performs queries using PyMySQL and MySQL Connector.

### 4. **MongoDB Queries (Exercise 4)**
   - This exercise focuses on querying a MongoDB database using different techniques, such as filtering documents, using aggregation pipelines, and indexing strategies.

### 5. **NoSQL Database Operations (Exercise 5 - MongoEngine)**
   - File: `exercise5.txt`
   - This file serves as the data source for MongoDB operations.
   - The script loads the data into a MongoDB collection and queries it using MongoEngine and PyMongo.

## Required Libraries
To run the scripts, install the following dependencies:

```sh
pip install pymysql
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install mongoengine
pip install pymongo
```

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have a MySQL database set up for Exercise 3.
2. For MongoDB, ensure that you have a running MongoDB instance.
3. Run the respective scripts to load and manipulate the data.
