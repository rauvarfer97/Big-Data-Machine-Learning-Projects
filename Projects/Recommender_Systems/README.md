# Music Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **music recommendation systems** using **collaborative filtering techniques**. The goal is to recommend **new artists** to users based on their listening history and preferences. The system calculates recommendations based on **Pearson correlation coefficients** and adjusts recommendations based on **user feedback**.

- **Jupyter Notebooks**
  - **`RecommenderSystem.ipynb`**: Implements a recommendation system using **collaborative filtering**.
  - **`FeedbackRecommenderSystem.ipynb`**: Enhances the recommender system by incorporating **user feedback** to refine suggestions.

- **Dataset (`Dataset.csv`)**  
  - Contains user listening history, including:
    - **Users** and their interactions with **artists**.
