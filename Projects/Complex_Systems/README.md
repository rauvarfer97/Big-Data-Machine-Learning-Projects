# NetLogo Simulations for Group Properties Evaluation

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing and analyzing **NetLogo** models to simulate a complex ecosystem. It extends the classic **Wolves Sheep Grass** model by introducing a new predator: **eagles**. Two versions of the model have been developed:

1. **Eagles Wolves Sheep Grass**: An ecosystem where eagles prey on both wolves and sheep, while wolves only prey on sheep.
2. **2.0 Eagles Wolves Sheep Grass**: Introduces competition where eagles and wolves can hunt and be hunted by each other.

The project includes simulations to study the impact of different parameters and initial conditions on ecosystem stability.

## Project Contents

- **PDF Report (`VarelaFerrando_Raul_SistComplejos.pdf`)**: A document detailing the theoretical background, model descriptions, methodology, simulation analysis, and conclusions.
- **NetLogo Models (`Netlogo_Models/`)**:
  - `2.0 Eagles Wolf Sheep Grass.nlogo`
  - `Eagles Wolf Sheep Grass.nlogo`

These files contain the NetLogo code required to run the models.

## Requirements and Dependencies

### **To Run the Models in NetLogo:**
1. Download and install **NetLogo** from the official website: [https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/)
2. Open NetLogo and load any of the `.nlogo` files included in the **Netlogo_Models** folder.
3. Adjust the simulation parameters according to the user's interest.
4. Run the simulation and analyze the results through the population counters and graphical outputs.

## Usage

1. Open **NetLogo**.
2. Load one of the models (`Eagles Wolf Sheep Grass.nlogo` or `2.0 Eagles Wolf Sheep Grass.nlogo`).
3. Configure the initial parameters:
   - Initial number of sheep, wolves, and eagles.
   - Grass regrowth time.
   - Energy gained from consuming different agents.
   - Reproduction probability for each species.
4. Run the simulation and observe changes in population dynamics and ecosystem balance.
